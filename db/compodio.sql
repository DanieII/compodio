The two discuss the Greenbelt, a 2.1 million-acre protected area stretching from the east to the west across the greater Toronto area. The region includes iconic landscapes like the Niagara Scarpement, the Oak Ridges Moraine, and the Great Lakes. The Greenbelt protects farmland, natural resources, and water resources. The idea of a greenbelt, a vast, protected area, is often mentioned as being larger than the Province of Prince Edward Island. The story behind the Greenbelt begins with a song by Sarah Harmer, which asks, \"If we blow a Hole in the Escarpment, will the Creek still Flow to The Great Lakes?\" This question has been answered by many protection measures over the years. In the early 80s, a number of measures were put in place to protect the escarpment, the Niagara, and Oak Ridge. Then, in the early 2000s, the Green Belt came into existence. It protects farmland and natural resources as well as water resources and agriculture systems. The foundation is an independent charity, which means it receives funding from the province, but it does not have to deal with land-use policy. There are other examples of the importance of protecting the landscape around the world, including the Iron Curtain, a Green Belt created after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

He\'s interested in plants, and particularly in a group of them called the Amalanchier family, which includes the Juneberry, the Shadbush, and the Saskatoonberry. He listens to the program every week to learn more about these plants. The first thing he does is read a book called \"Shrubs of Ontario\" by James H Soper. The book is written in the early 1980s, and it was put out only in 1982. The narrator notes that the name \"Amlancier\" comes from the French word for \"honey.\" He also notes that some of the flowers are long and some are short. He notes that there are many different kinds of plants that live in the same place, and that it\'s hard to tell which ones are the same. He also says that he likes the fruit, which is a bright red, and then fades to a dark purple. He names his bike Juneberry in honor of the berries. He decides to read some of John Eastman\'s book \"Forest and Thicket\" because he\'s really interested in how it describes plants. It describes plants in very simple terms.

He leads a walk with his partner in the Eroosa River Valley. They had a great time. The weather was beautiful and the landscape was beautiful. He wanted to learn more about the plants, so he decided to read some more. He chose to read a book about plants called \"nature\'s garden\" by Samuel Thayer, and a book called \"The book of field and roadside\" by John Eastman. The first book is from Samuel Thayer.

The leaves have hairs on the midrib, which is different from the leaves of the other plant. It is also very thin, unlike the other plants. The stalk looks like someone forgot to shrink the leaves. The plant has sessile leaves, which are smaller than the leaves in the rosette.

The group\'s leader, who is also known as \"Progosion,\" is wanted by the United States for his role in the murder of countless people. The pro-Putin faction of the Russian military, which includes some of the most powerful men in the country, is trying to take control of the situation. Some of these men, including Pavel Troigu, and Aleksey Girmazov, are loyal to Putin, while others, including Alexei Navalny, are running against him in the upcoming presidential election.

She was fascinated by the way that these different types of plants dictated the way the pollen was moved, and she was able to observe how those plants affected the way their species evolved. Rosalind was also interested in how these plants were able to change over time, so that the different types could mate and produce offspring that were of the same type. Rosalind is particularly interested in the question of \"perfect flowers,\" which she describes as \"wet that tail.\" She is also fascinated with the concept of gender, because \"the concepts of gender are extremely important.\" Rosalind describes a new project called \"Ontario Heritage and Feral Apples.\" The goal of the project is to better understand the distribution and abundance of domestic apples and to study the potential applications of these apples for cider production and wild environments.

The show is not sponsored by Burger King, but it does take their money, and they will work for coupons, which they will do whenever they get them. The program also discusses a recent strike at the Ontario Ministry of Education, which is 11 days old. The Education Minister has come out and said that they have reached a tentative agreement with the teachers. The teachers will have to go to arbitration, which means that the other three largest teachers unions will not be able to have a say in the negotiations. The government has also come out against the process of collective bargaining, arguing that it is too time-consuming and that it will only delay the inevitable. The strike vote doesn\'t mean that the teachers are on strike, says the show\'s host. He has been voting for collective agreements every single time he\'s voted on them. He finds this to be a back-pocket bargaining tactic that the government uses to try and get things done. On the flip side, he finds the tone of the strike different than it was in the past, when there were so many distractions in the school. Parents are still trying to catch up with the times, but there is no hard talk this time around.

The festival will bring the best of Canadian writing to the region. Adam also announces that he has won the Endurance Award at City Hall for surviving 44 hours of public meetings. The program also discusses the city\'s new transportation system, cashless payment, and the March for Children, an anti-LGBT movement that is getting louder. The show also discusses news from the past week, including Stephen Clark\'s sudden resignation, the naming of Paul Calandra as the new Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and a new trending hashtag, \"ResignedDougFord.\" The show then turns to the Ford administration\'s controversial Greenbelt plan, which has caused the resignation of Stephen Clark. In addition, the government has appointed John Mutton, a former mayor\'s development services company partner, as a new member of its cabinet. Mutton\'s lobbying firm has also made an appearance in the new cabinet. The government has also announced a new consultation process for the Greenbelt, which means that the government is not consulting with the public. The new government has not yet announced that it will halt the process, but rather that it is going to review all of its plans and come up with a final decision.

The program starts off with some music by a famous English composer named Sir Charles Villiers-Stanford. He was a symphonist, or teacher, in England. Stanford lived from 1852 until 1924 and wrote a piece for the end of World War I. This is one of the few recorded works of the war, and it deals with the death of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. The piece was written during a period of English history and English music when the British were trying to come up with a figure for the number of dead during the war. The Ulster Orchestra conducts Howard Shelley in the recording of the piece. Sound Magic goes back to some English music, and this time it\'s a little bit more German influence.

It uses a number of quotations from famous poets like Walt Whitman and John Donne. It also uses some military imagery.

In the year 2023, a strike by the American and Canadian actors resulted in a reduction in income for film and television professionals. To overcome these challenges, the Canadian Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Canadian Film Board have teamed up to create a special series of career-boosting opportunities for entertainment professionals.\n\nThe first of these opportunities is to feature the stories of professionals who have found alternative income-generating activities.

The third of these career-building opportunities is with the interview of Birgitta, an actor who is also a coach, a facilitator, and a media expert. Birgitta\'s career is still going strong even though she has already been an actor for many years. Her husband and she own a production company that produces plays, and she also does audio books.

They can marinate the riffs and ideas and then they let the horns on. DJ Morgan asks about the song title. They are very like sci-fi and fantasy.
